# Alpha Matting Algorithm Performance Comparison

A comprehensive comparison of alpha matting algorithms based on standardized performance metrics. This dataset provides researchers and developers with transparent benchmarking data to evaluate and compare different alpha matting approaches.

## Performance Metrics

The algorithms are evaluated using four key metrics:

- **SAD (Sum of Absolute Differences)**: Measures the absolute difference between predicted and ground truth alpha values. Lower values indicate better performance.
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: Calculates the average squared differences between predicted and ground truth values. Lower values indicate better performance.
- **Gradient**: Evaluates the preservation of edge information in the alpha matte. Lower values indicate better edge preservation.
- **Connectivity Error**: Measures the connectivity of the resulting alpha matte. Lower values indicate better connectivity preservation.
